* Based on my analysis of the overall Kickstarter data for Louise we have determined that the most popular type of theater in terms of Kickstarter campaigns are plays compared to musicals and spaces. More than half of the Kikcstarter information supplied for Plays shows that more than 2/3 were successful in their attempt to raise the funds set forth in the goal. Not limiting the base of country all theater Kickstarters see the most success in the month of May - June with a steady average decline in success after.   Although Louise is targeting 4000 as her goal she would be wise to reduce the amount.   The mean of the goal amount is approx. 4000 however the mean of the pledged amounts is closer to 1000.   About half of the Pledged amounts show less that 2000 which is in the 3rd quartile with the median of goals showing approx 2000.
